The Prompt

Design a macOS app icon for "RedMargin", a Markdown document viewer with Git change tracking.

CONCEPT:
A stylized document floating within a dark, sophisticated frame. The defining feature is a glowing red/rose vertical bar on the left edge—the "red margin" that represents Git change gutters.

STYLE:
- macOS Tahoe squircle format (rounded superellipse)
- Premium, minimal, slightly dimensional
- Dark theme with subtle depth and glow effects
- NOT flat—use subtle gradients, soft shadows, and light interplay

COMPOSITION:
- Outer layer: A thin, elegant frame or bezel in dark charcoal (#252528) with a subtle inner glow, giving the appearance of looking into a window or portal
- Inner area: Deep black-charcoal gradient (#1e1e21 to #161618)
- Document: A stylized page or card, slightly tilted or floating, in dark gray (#2a2a2e) with subtle paper texture or soft edges
- The document has faint horizontal lines suggesting rendered text (3-5 lines, subtle, in #3a3a3e)
- Dog-ear fold in top-right corner of document (optional, lighter shade)

THE RED MARGIN (critical brand element):
- A bold vertical bar on the left side of the document
- Color: Deep rose (#a64047) with subtle glow/bloom effect
- Should feel like it's softly illuminated from within
- This is the hero element—prominent but elegant

OPTIONAL ACCENTS:
- Tiny green and amber vertical bars to the left of the margin representing Git changes (added/modified lines)
- Very subtle—should not compete with the red bar
- Colors: #5cb85c (green), #d4a24a (amber)

LIGHTING:
- Subtle top-left light source
- The red margin has a soft glow that illuminates the nearby document edge
- Faint reflection or highlight on the frame bezel
- Overall moody, like a document glowing in a dark room

DO NOT:
- Use generic document icons or file folder metaphors
- Make it look like a text editor with visible code
- Use harsh colors or neon effects
- Include any text, letters, or symbols on the document
- Make it cluttered—keep it minimal and iconic

FEEL:
Premium developer tool. Quiet confidence. The kind of icon that belongs next to Sublime Text, iTerm, or Bear. Distinctive at small sizes (16px) but reveals elegant detail at large sizes (512px+).

OUTPUT:
1024x1024 PNG matching the icon background for the macOS squircle mask.

Alternative Prompt (More Abstract/Artistic)

Design an abstract macOS app icon representing "RedMargin"—a Markdown viewer with Git awareness.

CONCEPT:
A dark, moody portal or window with a bold vertical crimson line. Evokes the feeling of looking at a document in the quiet glow of a late-night coding session.

VISUAL:
- macOS squircle shape
- Deep charcoal background (#1e1e21) with subtle radial gradient toward edges
- A crisp, slightly glowing vertical line in rose-red (#a64047) positioned left-of-center
- The line has soft bloom/glow, like a neon tube in fog
- Faint horizontal "scan lines" or texture suggesting a document (very subtle, #2a2a2e)
- A thin outer frame/bezel giving depth—like looking through glass
- Optional: tiny vertical bars of green (#5cb85c) and amber (#d4a24a) to the left of the red line, suggesting Git diff markers

MOOD:
Minimal. Sophisticated. A developer tool that respects your dark mode. Premium but not pretentious.

AVOID:
- Literal document or file representations
- Text or letters
- Bright or neon colors
- Generic shapes

OUTPUT: 1024x1024 PNG
